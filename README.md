# numeric-cores: BluePrince puzzle
Bart Massey 2025

"Numeric cores" [puzzle](https://blue-prince.fandom.com/wiki/Numeric_Core)
from [BluePrince](https://www.blueprincegame.com/).

Group the digits of a 4-or-more-digit number into four
groups, then combine them using the operators -, *, / in
arbitrary order. Iterate until a 3-or-less-digit number is
found.  The "numeric cores" are those calculations that give
a well-defined answer: all steps positive, with division by
a positive number and producing an integer.

This solver assumes no zero digits in the input, as things
get confusing otherwise. Roman numerals are available but
a bit fragile.
